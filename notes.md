### Instructor Comments

+ This looks like a good start. I see a few places where model logic could be moved into service objects. In general, it best to refactor so that the models only return information about their instances and move all the action into a service object.
+ I also notice that a number of the methods on the Computer class are a little longer than five lines. See if you can simplify some of this logic into smaller helper methods
+ I also see that you're still working on finishing the game logic. Looking forward to seeing how it turns out when you're finished.
